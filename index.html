       <p id = "homep" width = 800px> Hello, my name is Kishan! This is my programming portfolio I coded at The University of Rhode Island. 
	       Above you see the Javascript button which shows all of my Javascript codes along with the App button which shows the different Apps I made. 
	       I also have an about me button that provides some information about me. This page is mostly for fun but who knows I might add onto this and use it as some sort of resume or something.
